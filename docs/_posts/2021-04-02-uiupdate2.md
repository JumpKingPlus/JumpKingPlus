This website is going through an update to make it look better than before, since some stuff didn't quite work as well as I thought. The Workshop page got remade with a new sleek look, a new tag page has arrived onto the site, so you can browse more levels with the same tags! 
Two new pages will come soon... <!-- more -->the next UI updates will roll out in this post once published for the public!

### [`Tags`](https://phoenixx19.github.io/JumpKingPlus/workshop/tags/) new section!

### Portal buttons!
Easier switch between the site portals with these easy buttons!

### Less clutter on the menu sidebar
I've removed the small pill calling the latest version of JumpKingPlus because it was making the sidebar look a lot cluttered on smaller desktop screens.

The total downloads has been moved in the footer.<br>...and a new Youtube link has appeared!
