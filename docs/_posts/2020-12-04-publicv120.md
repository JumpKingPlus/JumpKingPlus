  - And more!

- Added a __custom level__ on the [workshop section page](http://phoenixx19.github.io/JumpKingPlus/workshop/) to help you build your first level!

- Added an **external tool** (requested by MERNY!) called [JKPlusModManager](https://github.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/releases/download/v1.2.0/JKPlusModManager-v0.1.0.exe) that lets you:
  - Unload a previous mod
  - Load a new mod
  

Tweaks:
- Added the `Load and Save position` tool
  - Press `Insert` key to save position
  - Press `Home` key to load position 
  
### Fixes:
- Fixed installer causing problems with your binds, no more problems now!
- Fixed the "hardcoded babe" with the addition on the babe.xml file inside in settings folder. 
  <br>**Do not change this unless you know what you are doing!** _(thanks Erik from Nexile!)_
- Removed **Music Library** future feature to avoid copyright infringement from Nexile AB.
- Removed music items from custom maps to prevent massive sizes.

### Release fixes (rip previous 60 downloads :( )
- Updated installer the installer for the two common issues:
  - Missing `settings` folder
  - Already existing `Backup` folder
