_An enhanced version of Jump King._ ✨

JumpKingPlus is an **enhancement** for Jump King with plentiful of small tweaks to make your hard climb to the babe even better! JumpKingPlus fully **supports** the community around the game <!--  more --> and has taken notes on the features/tweaks the game was missing and implemented it (such as a quick restart system, disabling the NPC speeches for full focus on those hard jumps and so on!). The full list of features and tweaks can be found below.

## In-depth features
Small description for the features added.

### Discord Rich Presence
The first feature made onto JumpKingPlus has been the **Discord** integration using the Discord Rich Presence Client (RPC). 
>This has been a feature on it's own until now, JumpKingRPC won't get anymore big updates unless from this specific mod. If you are only interested about the Discord RPC mod, click [**here**](https://www.github.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingRPC).

This tool can let you choose over three possible presets:

<div class="rpc">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/master/docs/images/RichPresence1.gif">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/master/docs/images/RichPresence2.gif">
    <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/master/docs/images/RichPresence3.gif">
</div>


### Quick Restart
Very requested feature that speeds the time on restarting a new attempt. Below under **Hot keys** is the key for toggling the quick restart. The quick restart is about two times faster than `Save & Exit` and making a new attempt.


### Hot keys
Jump King on it's own it doesn't have complex keys - it's just left, right and space. But this minimalistic or simplistic choice makes cluttered and slow browsing the menus.
With this mod you can:
<div class="hk">
    <div>
        <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/master/docs/images/hotkeys.gif" style="margin-right: 1em;">
    </div>
    <div>
        <div>
            <ul>
                <li>Toggle <img class="icon" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/app-assets/726077029195448430/735954342825427134.png" height="20" style="vertical-align: sub;"> <strong>Snake Ring</strong> by pressing <code>O</code>.</li>
                <li>Toggle <img class="icon" src="https://cdn.discordapp.com/app-assets/726077029195448430/735947335305265202.png" height="20" style="vertical-align: sub;"> <strong>Giant Boots</strong> by pressing <code>P</code>.</li>
                <li>Call the <strong>Quick Restart</strong> option by pressing <code>Q</code>.</li>
            </ul>
        </div>
    </div>
</div>
<div style="clear: both; margin-top:1em;">
    <blockquote>If you have the tools on you can load previously saved position by pressing <code>Home</code> and
            save the position by pressing <code>Ins</code>.
    </blockquote>
</div>
<br>

### Custom mode
Custom mode is the name of a Jump King state that's triggered when a mod is installed. This enables:
- Support for custom hitboxes (level.xnb)
- Support for custom level screens (midground, foreground, background, scrolling and masks)
- Support for custom locations  
- Support for custom audio (music, ambient and sound effects)  
- Support for custom fonts  
- Support for custom props  
- Support for custom Jump King's inventory skins  
- Support for custom NPCs (textures, speeches and deals)  
- Support for custom ravens (birds and item carrying)  
- Support for custom ending screen titles   

... and much more! Check it out in the [**changelog**](https://phoenixx19.github.io/JumpKingPlus/publicv120/).

### Workshop <a href="https://phoenixx19.github.io/JumpKingPlus/workshop/"><img class="icon" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/master/docs/images/jkcustomapslogo.png" height="24" style="vertical-align: sub;" /></a>
The workshop is a section of the JumpKingPlus page where you can find:

- Custom levels
- Documentation on how to make your first levels
- Guidelines to post your level on the website
- Tips to improve your level

Either click on `Extras` > `Workshop` in-game, or click of the logo on the title to get in the workshop section!

### Menu overhaul
The menu has been reorganized to fit the JumpKingPlus features. You can see below a couple images of the new menu, the new `Stats display` and the inventory in the Main Menu.

![Menu](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/master/docs/images/menu.png)
![Menu2](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/master/docs/images/menu2.png)
![Pause](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Phoenixx19/JumpKingPlus/master/docs/images/pause.png)

The importance order of **Snake Ring** and **Giant Boots** can be seen inside the inventory in menu or in-game (obviously) in the image below.

<h3 id="egg">Easter eggs</h3>

With **JumpKingPlus**, there are included special unreleased lines that the merchants below will tell you once you reach that number of items! Have fun finding all of them!

|Story Mode|Seller|Quantity|Item|
|---|---|---|---|
|Main Babe|Merchant|69 |Gold Rings|
|New Babe+|NB+ Merchant|420|Silver|
|New Babe+|Snake|69|Ruby|
|GoTB|Shroom Guy|420|Mushrooms|
|GoTB|Mold Man|69|Ghost Fragments|

<h3 id="tools">Quote-on-quote cheats</h3>

One of these features has been the most requested and that is the Jump%; it shows on a scale from 1% to 100% the intensity of a jump (also known as "jump charge").
No fall and the teleport feature can be useful to warm-up in certain locations. The teleport feature is inspired over **DevilSquirrel's Jump King Manager**. Repo link below.

[![ReadMe Card](https://github-readme-stats.vercel.app/api/pin/?username=shootme&repo=livesplit.jumpking&show_owner=true)](https://github.com/ShootMe/LiveSplit.JumpKing)

>Most of these are made for **training** and **tutorials** only. <br>Cheats can be enabled/disabled in the `JumpKing.exe.config` file and manually in-game. When these enabled, achievements are **not** achieveable.

The four tools as said are:
      
- Jump% (last jump percentage and current jump percentage)
- No fall
- Precise teleport feature (`Ins` to save location, `Home` to teleport on the saved location)
- Teleport feature (possible only in the story mode selected)

## Future features
Features I'd like to add to JumpKingPlus after release:
