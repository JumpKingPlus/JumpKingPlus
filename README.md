> [!WARNING]
> Since 24th of February 2024, **JumpKingPlus has officially retired** in favor of the official Steam Workshop now available on Steam. Any of the releases won't work anymore since Jump King now runs at 64-bit by default and JumpKingPlus is based off of the 32-bit build of the game. Read more in the [**blog post**](https://jumpkingplus.github.io/the-good-ending/).

*An enhanced version of Jump King.* :sparkles:

JumpKingPlus is an **enhancement** for Jump King with plentiful of small tweaks to make your hard climb to the babe even better! JumpKingPlus fully **supports** the community around the game <!--  more --> and has taken notes on the features/tweaks the game was missing and implemented it (such as a quick restart system, disabling the NPC speeches for full focus on those hard jumps and so on!).
